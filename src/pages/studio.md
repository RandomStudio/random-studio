intro: >-
  Random is an independent experience design studio.<br /> We are strategists,
  designers and engineers from all over the world, collaborating with brands to
  trigger curiosity and use technology to spark new, unexpected connections
  between people and the space around them.


  How can we make the digital a living, breathing part of our world? We think
  and make as bodies.<br /> We explore how technology can be integrated into the
  very foundations of a space; as part of our physical world, engaging us to
  explore, play and wonder.


  We have a holistic, research-led approach that can be applied to products,
  experiences and platforms where spatial and digital design are integrated.
