    jobURL: https://randomstudio.bamboohr.com/jobs/view.php?id=10&source=aWQ9Nw%3D%3D
    jobDescription: |-
      Random is an experience design studio based in Amsterdam and Paris. Our work comes to life in the Interactive Space, a new domain, where the digital and the physical are fluid.

      We use technology in a human, tangible way and so invite people to connect to each other and the space they are in.

      We are looking for a Senior Experience Designer who can lead projects from start to end.

      You will be responsible for&#58;
      - Leading your project team
      - Creating concepts, designs and overseeing prototypes
      - Leading client conversations and bringing them along the project process

      ### Leading Teams
      Leading a team at Random means that you are responsible for the creative part of the project from A-Z. However, it does not mean that you are a hierarchical boss. Our team consists of different people from all kinds of disciplines, characters and strengths. You will shape and be part of the team and nurture a strong creative dynamic.

      ### Process
      For this role it is important that you understand which steps have to be taken to complete a project from strategic briefing to a fully delivered end result. You will work as a project lead and facilitate a team through research, ideation, art direction, prototypes and presentations. Furthermore, you will be responsible for instructing vendors (in collaboration with our producers) and delegating tasks to the project team.

      ### Client Connection
      We always try to make something new, this means instead of making something predefined, we will enter a creative process with our team and the client. It is important that you feel comfortable managing the creative energy between the client and us.

      By joining our team you will have the opportunity to&#58;
      - Explore new ways for physical spaces to merge with digital technologies to create elevated experiences and services
      - Work on concepts for forward-thinking brands
      - Be involved throughout the full design process, from strategy to prototype to production
      - Directly collaborate with art directors, ux designers, producers and technologists, external and internal. We don’t have a set signature and so enjoy working with many different people also outside of our own studio.
      - Work in a high autonomy, low control environment

      We expect you&#58;
      - To have minimal 4 years of experience in the field of spatial design, architecture, brand communication or interactive technologies
      - Are not fundamental about one approach to design and are able to synthesise various modes of thinking
      - To have a strong need to explore and make new things

      ### Random Studio Diversity & Inclusion Statement
      At Random Studio, we believe that an inclusive work environment and a diverse team are key to creating fresh and inspiring work. We’re looking for candidates who enrich our culture and challenge the status quo. We encourage everyone to bring their whole selves to work, and we strive to provide all candidates with an unbiased and accessible recruitment process.
