intro: >-
  Random is an independent experience design studio.<br /> We are strategists,
  designers and engineers from all over the world, collaborating with brands to
  trigger curiosity and use technology to spark new, unexpected connections
  between people and the space around them. <br> <br> How can we make the
  digital a living, breathing part of our world? How can technology be
  integrated into the very foundations of a space; as part of our physical
  world, engaging us to explore, play and wonder?

  <br> <br> We have a holistic, research-led approach that can be applied to
  products, experiences and platforms where spatial and digital design are
  integrated.

          Connected Spaces


          Blending digital and physical space, we create immersive, sensory
          experiences that open new worlds and evoke a sense of wonder. Our
          interactive environments are shaped by connectivity: they use
          technology in a tactile way, inviting people to play, reflect and
          explore.

          Human-Centered Products


          Drawing on in-depth research and technical expertise, we craft
          holistic global platforms for businesses and consumers that are both
          relevant and enduring. Extending beyond their primary function, the
          digital tools we build are experiential and boundary-pushing: they
          rethink and adapt to the way brands work today.

          Communication Formats


          Sparking new conversations between brands and their audiences, we
          disrupt existing formats to develop unique ways of communicating. Each
          project needs its own voice: we play with radical forms that capture
          the energy and many layers of a story in imaginative and surprising
          ways.
