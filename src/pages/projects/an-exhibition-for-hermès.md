title: An exhibition for Hermès
intro: >-
  At its core, the world of Hermès is a world of beautiful materials, mastered
  by highly skilled artisans. Festival des Métiers is a travelling exhibition
  that offers visitors the chance to meet the craftsmen of the house. We created
  three interactive exhibits that reveal the manufacturing details that normally
  remain invisible to the naked eye.
