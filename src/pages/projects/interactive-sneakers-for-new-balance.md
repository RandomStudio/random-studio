title: Interactive sneakers for New Balance
intro: >-
  To celebrate the launch of the New Balance 574S in Shanghai, we created an
  installation literally centred around the product: a pair of sneakers became
  interactive controllers for an immersive sound and light experience.

      Two custom-built infinity rooms - one at the store, the other erected
      temporarily at the entrance to a popular shopping mall nearby - invited
      the public to enter via a curved walkway bathed in pulsing light.


      Inside, the new 574S range is the hero, displayed on a glowing plinth
      which is the only light source for the curved interior.
