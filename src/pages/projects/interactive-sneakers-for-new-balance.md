title: Interactive sneakers for New Balance
intro: >-
  To celebrate the launch of the New Balance 574S in Shanghai, we created an
  installation literally centred around the product: a pair of sneakers became
  interactive controllers for an immersive sound and light experience.

      Two custom-built infinity rooms - one at the store, the other erected
      temporarily at the entrance to a popular shopping mall nearby - invited
      the public to enter via a curved walkway bathed in pulsing light.


      Inside, the new 574S range is the hero, displayed on a glowing plinth
      which is the only light source for the curved interior.

      Lifting the shoes from the plinth triggers an immediate change in light
      and sound. Visitors are free to touch and explore the shoe, and in the
      process intuitively discover the interaction mechanism. 




      Wireless motion sensors hidden inside each shoe allow users to shift the
      brightness and hue of the lighting, while the ambient audio subtly changes
      in response. Shaking the shoes or spinning them rapidly unlocks different
      sound and lighting effects.




      Before hearing a word of product information or marketing-speak, the
      installation allows visitors to enjoy an experience of playfulness and
      wonder connected directly with the product in their hands.

      The lack of visible cables helps the technology disappear, and the curved
      walls render the boundaries of the space invisible, too.
