title: Interactive sneakers for New Balance
intro: >-
  To celebrate the launch of the New Balance 574S in Shanghai, we created an
  installation literally centred around the product: a pair of sneakers became
  interactive controllers for an immersive sound and light experience.

      Using a giant bouncy ball, viewers can control the movement of the sun
      over a digitally sublime landscape: a hyper real vista where the sun’s
      cycle is recoded as a malleable event. Bridging the digital and the
      physical, SUN uses technology to reflect on how it’s shaping the way we
      experience the world.

      Developed in WebGL using the 3D framework Three.js and custom shaders, the
      manmade sun in the piece interacts with the atmosphere and scatters light
      across the crisp, digital horizon based on how you move the ball. SUN is
      projected on a big screen, summoning both the spectacular feeling of the
      sun whilst revelling in its own artificiality. Shifting across digital and
      physical space, the addictive experience of playing somewhere in-between
      the two triggers a split-second of awe when you realise what is in your
      power.
