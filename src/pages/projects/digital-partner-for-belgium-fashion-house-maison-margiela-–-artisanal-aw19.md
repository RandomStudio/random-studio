title: Digital Partner for Belgium fashion house Maison Margiela – Artisanal AW19
intro: >-
  Since Spring-Summer 19, we have been collaborating with Maison Margiela as a
  digital partner for six of their collections. Guided by John Galliano’s
  radical and unique vision, the collections are highly-considered
  constellations of ideas, craftsmanship and performance. Our job has been to
  understand the core concepts of each collection, and translate them into a
  multifaceted contemporary visual experience: from runway videos and live show
  streams to podcasts and photoshoots.


  Rather than ‘documenting’ an end-product, we have become part of the making-process itself. Drawing on the maison’s craft-based approach, we have come up with tailor-made formats and visual communication strategies that respond to the specific themes and language of each season. Building new forms that work alongside Galliano’s avant-garde thought-process, the digital universes we have created are an extension of the collection, rather than a documentation of it.

      Artisanal AW19


      The final stage of this cycle of decadence, this collection presents a breakdown of social structure and a carte-blanche for the future. Feeding this sense of decay into the garments themselves, the show featured projections of the nudes and fleshy close-ups of artist Katerina Jebb, harking back to a desire for authenticity and human instinct.

    caption: Playing on the idea of the ‘Trompe-l'oeil’, the assets we created – a
      show teaser, a runway video, a podcast teaser and a series of Instagram
      vignettes – ribbed off the layers of visual information present in the
      show, blurring the line between the clothes, the projections and the space
      itself. Working closely with Katerina, we were also responsible for
      translating her ideas into the show scenography, in which projections of
      the human form filled the walls.
