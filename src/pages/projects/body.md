  BODY 
intro: >-
  A new collaboration between Random Studio and artist Philip Schuette, BODY
  invites you to get physical and use your body as a search term for images.
  Strike a pose and watch it reflected back through images, excavated from the
  bottomless global bin of the internet. Each time you move, your digital series
  of associations moves with you, cycling through thousands of different online
  images: holiday snaps, artwork, animals, sculptures, selfies â€“ and whatever
  other surprises among the digital debris may surface.

      Usually a computer senses us through our fingertips; our encounters are
      distant and mediated by limiting physical modes of interaction. BODY,
      instead, sucks up the whole body, using it as an interface itself to start
      a new and uncanny conversation with the machine. The common language of
      images becomes a point of departure for an embodied conversation between
      the physical and the digital: a dialogue of mutual exploration and
      curiosity.

      BODY presented the opportunity to play with hyper-responsive code that
      allows for novel and physical interactions between people and algorithms.
      Our development team combined freely-available neural network (AI)
      libraries and a custom media pipeline to process the hundreds of thousands
      of images required. Live pose tracking, graphics and sound were generated
      in-browser with high performance web technologies.
