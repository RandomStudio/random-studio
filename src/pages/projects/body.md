  A playful interactive search engine for Cinekid  Festival
intro: >-
  In another collaboration with artist Philip Schuette, this installation
  invites you to get physical and use your body as a search term for images.
  Strike a pose and watch it reflected back through images, excavated from the
  bottomless global bin of the internet.

      Each time you move, your digital series of associations moves with you,
      cycling through thousands of different online images: holiday snaps,
      artwork, animals, sculptures, selfies â€“ and whatever other surprises among
      the digital debris may surface.

      Usually a computer senses us through our fingertips; our encounters are
      distant and mediated by limiting physical modes of interaction. BODY,
      instead, sucks up the whole body, using it as an interface itself to start
      a new and uncanny conversation with the machine. 


      The common language of images becomes a point of departure for an embodied
      conversation between the physical and the digital: a dialogue of mutual
      exploration and curiosity.

      BODY presented the opportunity to play with hyper-responsive code that
      allows for novel and physical interactions between people and algorithms.
      Our development team combined freely-available neural network (AI)
      libraries and a custom media pipeline to process the hundreds of thousands
      of images required. Live pose tracking, graphics and sound were generated
      in-browser with high performance web technologies.
