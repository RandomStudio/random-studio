  Interactive Lookbook for Fred Perry x Raf Simons 
intro: "For our third collaboration with Fred Perry x \LRaf Simons, we continued to explore further possibilities of the 360 world, this time revolving around their SS20 collection. \n\nThe house party we made for the AW19 shoot isn’t over yet: this meta-experience invites you backstage into a sweeping warehouse space filled with the same models and photographers at work on set."

      Here, instead of moving through time and space, you can jump from gaze to
      gaze, travelling through the space to piece together fragments of the
      story via a multiplicity of perspectives. Inspired by Gavin Watson’s
      iconic imagery, which remains at the heart of the collection – this time
      in colour – each viewpoint offers a fresh take on the scene. Staging,
      deconstructing and re-recording, the immersive environment plays on
      photography’s ability to direct and frame our attention.
