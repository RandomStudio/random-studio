title: A studio sun system with light-artist Arnout Meijer
intro: Like many studios, we’re based in the city. Located in a courtyard within
  a housing block, our space doesn’t get much direct sunlight in winter. Using
  this problem as a tool in our research into interactive space, we started to
  think about how we could connect our physical space to the outdoors in order
  to bring our workspace back to life during these winter months.

    caption: How can a space connect with its surroundings? Can we use technology to
      craft something organic? How can we work with light as a material? With
      these questions in mind, we set out to build a lighting system that
      emulates the movement of the sun and the ever-evolving states of natural
      light that we were missing out on.

      created mimics the behaviour of the sun travelling overhead in our studio.
      Light, of course, is anything but static: we observed its movement,
      intensity and colour temperature to mirror the changes that occur outside
      and subtly interact with the natural light of the studio. Each day in our
      workspace will be dynamic, interspersed with little moments of difference
      and change as the light outside shifts, revitalising the space with the
      energy of the sun."

      This is just the beginning of how our studio can come to life. The dynamic
      system we created allows us to control each LED light pixel individually,
      and the next step is to add sound to our space. Our studio is becoming the
      playground we use to think about how technology can build a bridge between
      humans and nature, with the aim of creating interactive spaces that feel
      alive and behave in their own way.


      A programmable space like this creates a dialogue with the people that occupy it. Rather than isolating us from the physical world, it infuses real spaces with tech to make us aware of our surroundings.
