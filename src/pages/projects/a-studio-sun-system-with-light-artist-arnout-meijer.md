title: An Interactive Studio Sun together with light-artist Arnout Meijer
intro: Like many studios, we’re based in the city. Located in a courtyard within
  a housing block, our space doesn’t get much direct sunlight in winter. Using
  this problem as a tool in our research into interactive space, we started to
  think about how we could connect our physical space to the outdoors in order
  to bring our workspace back to life during these winter months.

    caption: Does office light need to be static in order to work? How can we work
      with light as a material? Can we use technology to craft something
      organic? How can a space connect with its surroundings? With these
      questions in mind, we set out to build a lighting system that emulates the
      movement of the sun and the ever-evolving states of natural light that we
      were missing out on.

    caption: "Collaborating with light artist Arnout Meijer, the ambient system we
      created mimics the behaviour of the sun travelling overhead in our studio.
      Light, of course, is anything but static: we observed its movement,
      intensity and colour temperature to mirror the changes that occur outside
      and subtly interact with the natural light of the studio. Each day in our
      workspace will be dynamic, interspersed with little moments of difference
      and change as the light outside shifts, revitalising the space with the
      energy of the sun."

    caption: This is just the beginning of how our studio can come to life. The
      dynamic system we created allows us to control each LED light pixel
      individually, and the next step is to add 4D sound to our space. Our
      studio is becoming the playground we use to think about how technology can
      build a bridge between humans and nature, with the aim of creating
      interactive spaces that feel alive and behave in their own way. A
      programmable space like this creates a dialogue with the people that
      occupy it. Rather than isolating us from the physical world, it infuses
      real spaces with tech to make us aware of our surroundings.

  ogDescription: "Can you bring the outside in? During the winter months, we miss
    out on a lot of natural light in our studio. So we got to work to bring some
    sunshine back in. Our ambient light system mimics the changing light of the
    day, like a sun moving over our workspace. A playground for our research
    into interactive space, our Amsterdam studio is slowly coming to life. "
