title: A vertical journey through time for Chanel
intro: >-
  French fashion house Chanel is known for a continuous strive for excellence
  and perfection. For the introduction of the Chanel Première Camélia Skeleton
  watch at the international watch show Baselworld 2017, we translated the
  qualities of the precious watch into a memorable, intimate voyage.

      Called Chanel Timebox, the Chanel booth was morphed into a modern-day time
      machine that invited visitors on a vertical journey through space and
      time. Only a single visitor at a time could embark by setting foot on the
      floor part of the unusual L-shaped screen that made up the dynamic booth,
      providing for an individual experience.

      Acknowledging the octagonal design of the watch case, the journey took off
      at the similar-shaped Place Vendôme in Paris, from which curious visitors
      were warped into the galaxy.
