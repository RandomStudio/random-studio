title: "Digital Partner for Belgium fashion house Maison Margiela - Défilé AW19 "
intro: >-
  Since Spring-Summer 19, we have been collaborating with Maison Margiela as a
  digital partner for six of their collections. Guided by John Galliano’s
  radical and unique vision, the collections are highly-considered
  constellations of ideas, craftsmanship and performance. Our job has been to
  understand the core concepts of each collection, and translate them into a
  multifaceted contemporary visual experience: from runway videos and live show
  streams to podcasts and photoshoots.




  Rather than ‘documenting’ an end-product, we have become part of the making-process itself. Drawing on the maison’s craft-based approach, we have come up with tailor-made formats and visual communication strategies that respond to the specific themes and language of each season. Building new forms that work alongside Galliano’s avant-garde thought-process, the digital universes we have created are an extension of the collection, rather than a documentation of it.

      Défilé AW19 


      The idea of digital decadence explored in the recent Artisanal show was filtered down for this ready-to-wear collection, with garments stripped back down into a more purified and minimal form. Inspired by retelling the classic story of Swan Lake to the dramatic overtones of Tchaikovsky’s music, Galliano’s research swings this time towards the idea of ‘Transformation’.

    caption: We explored the spirit of this contemporary Swan Lake through a variety
      of different formats, from a show teaser and a runway video to a podcast
      teaser. Peeking into Galliano’s vivid imagination and well of inspiration,
      it was hailed as the first of its kind in the fashion industry – a bold
      new form that pulled the curtain back on the process of creation. Cut
      together with images from the show, the teaser recounted this abstracted
      version of Swan Lake through his cast of models, narrated by Galliano
      himself.
