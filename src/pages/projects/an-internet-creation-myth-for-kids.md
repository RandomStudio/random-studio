title: An internet creation myth for kids
intro: >-
  We launched an activation for Cinekid Festival that tells the story of how the
  internet was invented.




  We made both an online and physical representation of the project, that allowed us to create an immersive world that works on all devices, installation, mobile and desktop so regardless of the physical position you can escape into a well and unleash your imagination.
