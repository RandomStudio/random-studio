templateKey: Project
title: An internet creation myth for kids
intro: >-
  We launched an activation for Cinekid Festival that tells the story of how the
  internet was invented.




  We made both an online and physical representation of the project, that allowed us to create an immersive world that works on all devices, installation, mobile and desktop so regardless of the physical position you can escape into a well and unleash your imagination.


  Experience is here: http://parallelarchaeologies.geoffreylillemon.com/

    caption: Parallel Archaeologies is an ancient portal that has opened up at the
      bottom of a well, like a blackhole it sucks our attention inwards
      streaming distortions of alternate internets and code cracked dimensions
      as we fall into a cosmic spiraling binary bliss, that is, until the
      robotic hacker cats messed it all up.
