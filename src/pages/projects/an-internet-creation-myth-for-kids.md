templateKey: Project
title: An internet creation myth for kids
intro: >-
  We launched an activation for Cinekid Festival that tells the story of how the
  internet was invented.




  We made both an online and physical representation of the project, that allowed us to create an immersive world that works on all devices, installation, mobile and desktop so regardless of the physical position you can escape into a well and unleash your imagination.

    caption: Parallel Archaeologies is an ancient portal that has opened up at the
      bottom of a well, like a blackhole it sucks our attention inwards
      streaming distortions of alternate internets and code cracked dimensions
      as we fall into a cosmic spiraling binary bliss, that is, until the
      robotic hacker cats messed it all up.

    caption: It all started when The Gods assembled a select group of ancient
      avatars to decide upon the shape of a new, fantasy universe. But, once
      they got to work, they quickly realized that they couldn't agree! The
      mermaid wanted it square, the centaur wanted it cylindrical, and the
      reptilian wanted it mobius...

      Frustrated by their inability to decide they all fell into a deep
      slumber...


      While they slept, a clowder of hacker cats descended upon them to steal their avatar code and send it to an AI engine, essentially spoiling their plans.

      When the ancients awoke they found themselves trapped inside of an
      artificial intelligence software in which their identities were consumed
      by data libraries. Stuck with only fragments of their eyes freaking out,
      the internet collapsed, sending the universe into an endless binary
      blackhole.




      That is, until it restartsâ€¦
