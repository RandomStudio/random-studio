  COS Pop-Up Installation
intro: COS commissioned us to create a pop-up concept store during Salone del
  Mobile in Milan. Located in the Lambrate district, our installation
  transformed the brand’s signature minimalism into a spatial experience.

    caption: Taking the theme of the collection, ‘Modern Utility’, as a starting
      point, we became interested in simple optimized forms created by modern
      technologies. Using RIM (Reactive Injection Moulding) to design the
      installation, we built a modular display that can be reassembled into an
      infinite number of geometric forms, drawing on the structural codes of the
      atom. Built from contrasting and tactile materials, the installation’s
      straight lines were ruptured by soft rope, playing with form and function.
