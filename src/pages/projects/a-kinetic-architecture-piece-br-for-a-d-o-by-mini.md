title: A kinetic architecture piece <br> for A/D/O by MINI
intro: >-
  In celebration of the US launch of MINI Electric, we were commissioned to
  create an immersive installation that merged the vibrant energy of the iconic
  car with the studio’s signature style at their A/D/O creative space in
  Brooklyn.

      The result – Perpetuum – is a kinetic experience that sets in motion the
      dreamy feeling of staring out of a window as the landscape zooms past you,
      fuelled by the flux of our current environment.

      The installation creates a meditative abstraction of a city in perpetual
      motion. Three rotating rings orbit around a central light sculpture,
      generating countless overlapping compositions, layering impression over
      impression. Drifting through this ‘third’ space, the viewer’s experience
      changes from moment to moment, enhanced by an ambient patchwork of urban
      sounds.
