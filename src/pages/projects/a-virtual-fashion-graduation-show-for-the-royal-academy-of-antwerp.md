title: A virtual fashion graduation show for the Royal Academy of Antwerp
intro: Known for their impressive graduation shows, the Fashion Department of
  the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp commissioned us to think about how to
  translate this year’s event into the digital. How to bring the energy and
  experience of the physical runway to the screen? What kind of platform
  accommodates the diverse – and potentially last minute – range of works
  created by their large group of students?

    caption: We used the opportunity to think forward to the possibilities of future
      fashion shows. In our vision, physicality remains at the heart of this
      digital architecture. We deconstructed/abstracted the mechanisms and
      internal logic of the traditional fashion show, re-imagining how they
      could play out in virtual space in front of a global audience.

    caption: Through the traditional eyes of classic fashion show cameras, the
      visitor is invited to view and experience a innovative digital
      event.[WWW.SHOWWW](http://www.showww) takes place in an online structure
      that references our shared understanding of space, but is enhanced using
      digital tools. The platform independently showcases the elaborate
      creations of all 140 Bachelor students across three year levels and 9
      Masters’ students in an event that unfolds live over a number of hours,
      and can then be rewatched on a timeline afterwards.
