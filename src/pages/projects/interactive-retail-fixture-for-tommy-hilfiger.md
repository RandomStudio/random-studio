title: Interactive retail fixture <br> for Tommy Hilfiger
intro: >-
  While Tommy Hilfiger’s Kids’ Collection is extensive, it is usually only
  available in a handful of their larger stores. Without taking up limited floor
  space or introducing new stock, how can you make people aware that the
  collection even exists? Through play. We drew on our two areas of
  specialisation – experiential installations and retail platforms – to create
  an interactive store fixture that provides a solution to the puzzle: the Tommy
  Hilfiger Kids Machine.
