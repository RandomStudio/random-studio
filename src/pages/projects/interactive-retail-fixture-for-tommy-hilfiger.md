  Interactive retail fixture

  for Tommy Hilfiger
intro: >-
  While the Tommy Hilfiger Kids’ Collection is extensive, it is usually only
  available in a handful of their stores. Without taking up too much floor space
  or introducing new stock, how could you make people aware that this collection
  exists? Through play.


  We drew on our two areas of specialisation – experiential installations and
  retail platforms – to create an interactive store fixture that provides a
  solution to the puzzle: the Tommy Hilfiger Kids Machine.

      Playfully shaped like a stack of boxes, the Kids Machine is colourful and
      eye-catching with bright tubes of moving lights protruding from its sides.
      The central touchscreen is framed by dials, glowing buttons and a giant
      slider and sound effects are emitted from a visible speaker grille.

      More arcade game than information screen, the design is tactile, inviting
      passersby to stop and explore. Curiosity is rewarded with an interactive
      experience that is both fun and informative. Moving a slider to choose a
      specific height or turning a dial to pick a colour results in immediate
      feedback on-screen, accompanied by lively light animations and sounds.

      The key functionalities of the machine are simple and clear: you can
      browse the Kids Collection, purchase items and create a wishlist. Building
      on our previous work for the Store of the Future platform, which powers
      much of Tommy Hilfiger’s in-store digital experience, the Kids Machine is
      different in presentation: carefully-prototyped hardware controls replace
      almost all of the interface that is normally represented on-screen. By
      encouraging play, the experience of the Kids Machine evokes the brand
      values of the collection itself.

      The result was a real success story that saw double the rates of
      engagement and conversion compared to other touch screens in store. We see
      this as an exciting step forward in our long-term work on the Store of the
      Future that demonstrated the possibilities in merging retail platforms
      with interactive installations.
