  A Spatial Listening Experience for Bottega Veneta 
intro: To showcase Daniel Lee’s AW 2020 collection for Bottega Veneta in Seoul,
  we were enlisted to design a pop-up experience and store scenography. Drawing
  inspiration from its location next to the iconic Hyundai Card Music
  Library, we created a spatial listening experience based on the ‘Acousmonium’
  sonic installations as pioneered by Francois Bayle in the 1970s.

    caption: Housed in a reflective inflatable structure in front of the building,
      the experience blended acoustic properties with architecture and
      aesthetics, nestling 24 speakers of various sizes into its voluminous
      walls to produce a three-dimensional sonic landscape, determined by the
      speakers’ varying frequency response. Upon entering, visitors encountered
      an atmospheric, evolving soundscape that they can explore with their
      bodies, by moving or staying still. Layers of sound overlap to conjure up
      different dreamscapes – the gentle seascape of Ischia, the tranquility of
      a morning hike through the hills of Jeju Island, the bustle of New York’s
      streets – woven together with musical elements created by Seungmin Cha.

    caption: The aesthetics of the installation were mirrored inside the Vinyl &
      Plastic pop-up store next door, where we designed the product displays out
      of reflective materials and inflated structures. The two locations allowed
      for a focused experience design; one dedicated to an immersive brand
      experience and the other a powerful product display, with both sharing art
      direction and concept.

    Francois Bayle, we made an inflatable sonic installation to mark the launch
    of Daniel Lee’s AW 2020 collection for Bottega Veneta in Seoul. Reflecting

    visitors a dreamy spatial listening experience that transformed with every
