  An exploration into mixed reality setups
intro: We’ve been thinking about the future of in-store experiences. What if you
  could literally step into the world of a product? Mixed reality (XR)
  experiences propose a new kind of immersive and adaptable brand encounter.
  Transforming any space into a pop-up dynamic visual landscape, customers are
  invited to step into the creative vision of a collection.

    caption: Each experience is unique. As you pick up a garment or product, the
      surrounding environment transforms using head and camera tracking to
      respond in real-time to your presence. Exploring the space with your body,
      you can experience the product from different perspectives, immersed in
      the atmosphere created by LED and stage lighting. Leave with a takeaway to
      remember your experience and share it online.

    caption: From in-store installations to product launches, from photobooths to
      Instagram filters, XR Stages are flexible to suit different shapes, scales
      and seasons and host a range of different content. Customers can enter
      into campaign imagery or a product story, or give products a ‘test-drive
      in real-life contextual scenarios. Offering a range of unique, sensorial
      product experiences, XR Stages bridge the digital and physical to create a
      memorable customer journey.
