title: Interactive lookbook  for Fred Perry x Raf Simons
intro: >-

  The experience invites you to step into multiple narratively connected
  three-dimensional photographs, that display the evening of a regular house
  party - familiar to all of us.


  The 80s Youth Archive photographs are centre stage of the Fred Perry x Raf
  Simons AW19 collection. They are also the main source of reference for this
  seasonâ€™s interactive lookbook which pays homage to the energy and feel of the
  era.

      The visitor is welcomed as a guest into a virtual house unfolding
      different moments in time of a house party narrative. The visitor can
      explore and browse the collection through the eyes of evolving characters
      and social interactions as the night progresses. This way the user
      navigates through an intimate setting of friends talking, dancing and
      eventually extending their stay, all wearing the new Fred Perry x Raf
      Simons collaboration.
