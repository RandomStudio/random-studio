title: 'Bottega Veneta Takeover at Saks Fifth Avenue '
intro: >-
  To celebrate its SS20 collection, Bottega Veneta commissioned us to take over
  the windows of New York’s Saks Fifth Avenue and create 5 pop-up areas indoors.
  We partnered with Bonsoir Paris to concept and design, and together we took
  the takeover task literally. Through subtle interventions in the architecture
  of Saks itself, we created a bold stage for Bottega’s collection.

      Transformation was at the root of our takeover and the shapes and forms of
      the Saks building became our raw material. We recreated various
      architectural elements, allowing them to morph and change in response to
      the shapes, weights and forms of Bottega’s products, as if the objects
      could rejig any surface they came into contact with. Inspired by the
      free-form, liquid world of 3D – where environments can be duplicated and
      realities distorted – Saks Fifth Avenue and Bottega Veneta meet and merge
      to create hybrid, gravity-defying spatial designs.

      From the six windows overlooking the city’s streets to the multiple
      interventions scattered inside the store, visitors encountered the
      takeover as a non-linear journey of discovery. The space is almost as it
      once was, but a second glance reveals a series of glitches that have
      mutated parts of the ten-floor building.
