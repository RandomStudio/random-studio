    caption: "The Kid’s Pod is a game station with a difference: you are the
      controller and there are no rules. The movements of your body shape and
      change the journey of the on-screen athletes, challenging them to excel
      and activate three different ‘innovations’. There’s no beginning and no
      end: all you need to do is step in front of the screen and explore."

    caption: Inspired by the spontaneity and energy of parkour, the possibilities of
      the Kid’s Pod are limitless. With no instructions or interface, the
      hexagonal structure creates a 360° play area that invites kids to discover
      the game intuitively, and even team up for a multiplayer mode. The more
      you play, the more you learn.
