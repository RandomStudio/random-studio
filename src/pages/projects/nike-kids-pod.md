    caption: "The Kid’s Pod is a game station with a difference: you are the
      controller and there are no rules. The movements of your body shape and
      change the journey of the on-screen athletes, challenging them to excel
      and activate three different ‘innovations’. There’s no beginning and no
      end: all you need to do is step in front of the screen and explore."
