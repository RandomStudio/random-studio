title: J12 Place Vendome Takeover
intro: >-
  For its biggest ever global watch launch, Chanel enlisted Random Studio to
  create the scenography for a temporary takeover of its flagship boutique on
  Place Vendôme in Paris. The new J12 series revolves around encounters and
  decisive moments, and needed a fittingly momentous occasion to celebrate its
  launch. Through shaping the colour and light inside the building, our design
  aimed to hijack visitors’ sense of time, giving them a surreal and sensory
  experience inspired and directed by a series of short campaign films.

      The illusion reached its peak in the Grand Salon: the iconic view out onto
      Place Vendôme was replaced by a simulation that allowed the room to travel
      through time, slipping between warm sunsets, foggy mornings and glowing
      afternoon skies. The sun traces through the sky, shadows dart across the
      square and cars race backwards, as different Chanel muses invite visitors
      into their favourite memories in short films screened on the walls. This
      magical light dance reverberated through the different rooms of the store,
      and also became the spearhead for two other J12 launch events that we
      organised, in Beijing and Taiwan.
