title: "Tide Window Display for Alexander McQueen "
intro: We worked with Alexander McQueen to design a display for their flagship
  store in London to showcase the new Curve bag. Drawing inspiration from the
  SS21 campaign film directed by Jonathan Glazer – a dystopian short unfolding
  on the banks of the capital’s iconic River Thames – we created a display that
  mirrors the movement of the tide to bring the peace and tranquility of the
  natural world into the heart of the city.

    caption: Framed by the window, the three-layer-deep row of bags mimic the
      natural cycle of the river, gradually rising to reach ‘high tide’ where
      they oscillate up and down like waves before descending to ‘low tide’.
      Echoing the rhythmic ebb and flow of the Thames, the installation mediates
      the river’s slow and steady ‘breath’ in real-time.

    caption: Implanting a moment of calm into the midst of a busy shopping street,
      the window’s gentle tempo invites passersby to slow down, reconnect to the
      pace of a river-side stroll and lose themselves in a few minutes of
      contemplation. Starting in London, the display will travel on a world tour
      taking the tide and its cycle to different cities.
