title: Digital Partner for Belgium fashion house Maison Margiela
intro: >-
  Since Spring-Summer 19, we have been collaborating with Maison Margiela as a
  digital partner for six of their collections. Guided by John Galliano’s
  radical and unique vision, the collections are highly-considered
  constellations of ideas, craftsmanship and performance. Our job has been to
  understand the core concepts of each collection, and translate them into a
  multifaceted contemporary visual experience: from runway videos and live show
  streams to podcasts and photoshoots.




  Rather than ‘documenting’ an end-product, we have become part of the making-process itself. Drawing on the maison’s craft-based approach, we have come up with tailor-made formats and visual communication strategies that respond to the specific themes and language of each season. Building new forms that work alongside Galliano’s avant-garde thought-process, the digital universes we have created are an extension of the collection, rather than a documentation of it.

      Défilé AW20


      Continuing on the theme of remixing the house’s heritage, Galliano’s concept of ‘Recicla’ – resurrecting and deconstructing shapes from the past – was at the core of this collection. Driven by a new obsession with uniforms, the garments played on the idea of ‘work-in-progress’ as a new approach for the house’s future.
