title: An Interactive Studio Sun together with light-artist Arnout Meijer
intro: Located in a courtyard within a housing block, our studio doesnâ€™t get
  much direct sunlight in winter. Using this problem as a tool in our research
  into interactive space, we started to think about how we could connect our
  physical space to the outdoors in order to bring our workspace back to life
  during these winter months.

    caption: Does office light need to be static in order to work? How can we work
      with light as a material? Can we use technology to craft something
      organic? How can a space connect with its surroundings? With these
      questions in mind, we set out to build a lighting system that emulates the
      movement of the sun and the ever-evolving states of natural light that we
      were missing out on.

    caption: "Collaborating with light artist Arnout Meijer, the ambient system we
      created mimics the behaviour of the sun travelling overhead in our studio.
      Light, of course, is anything but static: we observed its movement,
      intensity and colour temperature to mirror the changes that occur outside
      and subtly interact with the natural light of the studio. Each day in our
      workspace will be dynamic, interspersed with little moments of difference
      and change as the light outside shifts, revitalising the space with the
      energy of the sun."

      This is just the beginning of how our studio can come to life. The dynamic system we created allows us to control each LED light pixel individually, and the next step is to add 4D sound to our space. Our studio is becoming the playground we use to think about how technology can build a bridge between humans and nature, with the aim of creating interactive spaces that feel alive and behave in their own way.

       A programmable space like this creates a dialogue with the people that occupy it. Rather than isolating us from the physical world, it infuses real spaces with tech to make us aware of our surroundings.
