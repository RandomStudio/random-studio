title: An Archival Experience celebrating C.P. Company’s 50th Anniversary
intro: >-
  We were proud to join C.P. Company’s 50th anniversary Cinquanta celebrations to help them bring their rich archive to life – in both a physical and digital form. Working with five-decade’s worth of their hybrid urban sportswear, objects, sketches and editorials, we created an interactive spatial archive in a repurposed car park in Darwen, UK, as part of the 2021 British Textile Biennale, as well as a dynamic online archive. A hybrid of physical and digital space, the exhibition offers visitors an embodied experience of the often-hidden brand archive.

    caption: The online archive we designed pays homage to Osti’s trailblazing
      process-based vision, bringing together five-decade’s worth of garments,
      objects, sketches and editorials into a behind-the-scenes experience of
      the lab. Visitors can journey through the archive as Osti himself might
      use it.

      Each artefact is of equal importance, grouped together on the landing
      page yet navigable using a filter-system. Clicking on an object leads you
      on a deep-dive into its life-story, from pre-production research to how
      it’s worn on the streets today.

    caption: Informed by C.P.’s material processes, the website transitions
      reference the tactility of each artefact, inviting visitors to feel the
      garments as well as read about them. A tool that collects, highlights and
      contextualises the research behind the brand’s innovation, the archive is
      a living entity; one that can be added to in years to come.

      For the physical rendition of the archive, premiering at Pitti Uomo, we
      created an installation where visitors can ‘scroll’ through the online
      archive. Upon entering the pavilion, visitors encounter a single archive
      rack framing a flag fashioned out of 50 patches of dyed fabric; a symbolic
      object to celebrate C.P. Company’s Cinquenta. This rack is used as a
      control to navigate through the digital archive so the public can immerse
      themselves in C.P. Company’s story through audio and images. A hybrid of
      physical and digital space, the exhibition offers visitors an embodied
      experience of the often-hidden brand archive.
