title: An Archival Experience celebrating C.P. Company’s 50th Anniversary
intro: >-
  We were proud to join C.P. Company’s 50th anniversary Cinquanta celebrations to help them bring their rich archive to life – in both a physical and digital form. Working with five-decade’s worth of their hybrid urban sportswear, objects, sketches and editorials, we created an interactive spatial archive in a repurposed car park in Darwen, UK, as part of the 2021 British Textile Biennale, as well as a dynamic online archive. A hybrid of physical and digital space, the exhibition offers visitors an embodied experience of the often-hidden brand archive.

    The retrospective’s location in Darwen paid homage to the C.P. Company’s special relationship with the British working class youth in the north of England who have contributed to its legacy. For 10 days, the car park transformed into a behind-the-scenes look at the brand’s vision. Visitors could explore 65 different garments housed in archive racks, each presented with a scannable Garment Card that allowed them to continue their journey online into the digital archive and its wider ecosystem of related content.
