title: Creative direction of film production for Maison Margiela
intro: Headed up by John Galliano, Maison Margiela’s ‘Artisanal’ is a high
  concept collection that embodies the radical spirit of the house, whilst
  pushing the boundaries of its ever-evolving language. For Spring-Summer 19
  Couture, Galliano enlisted us as a digital partner to amplify the coverage of
  his extravagant runway show.

  - caption: This season was part of Galliano’s research into a ‘New Glamour’, with
      the latest instalment revolving around the cyclical nature of decadence. A
      riot of bright colours and jittering computer-generated imagery, the
      collection bubbles with the excess and artifice of the digital world and
      its flood of overlapping information. This baroque visual chaos needed to
      be translated into the documentation of the show, which played on the
      borders of fake and real.

  - caption: The show itself was a spectacle-like affair so we captured it from
      every angle and perspective, creating a stream of different images and
      content including the main runway video, live-editing for Instagram Live,
      a pre-show teaser, a podcast teaser, a series of backstage videos and
      backstage and empty-set photography.

  - caption: The main video played on the reflected images of the mirrored runway,
      shot with rotating cameras to blur the lines between reality and its
      image. For a finishing touch, we brought to life the key motif of the
      collection – the poodle – who became the show’s protagonist.
