title: 'Travel exhibition ‘Volez, Voguez, Voyagez’ for Louis Vuitton'
intro: >-
  Louis Vuitton’s traveling exhibition “Volez, Voguez, Voyagez” (Fly, Sail,
  Travel) retraces the adventure of the House of Louis Vuitton from 1854 to the
  present. For the Seoul, New York City and Shanghai editions of this
  exhibition, we created high-impact entrance statements to welcome guests into
  Louis Vuitton's world of travel.

      For the Shanghai edition, we created an atmospheric space, in-between
      night and day, adorned with lanterns and flooded by neon light. Hanging
      from the ceiling in an assortment of shapes and sizes, each lantern was
      embedded with LED panel with synchronised scrolling messages and graphics,
      welcoming visitors. Overhead, we installed an ever-shifting digital
      ‘skylight’, animated by moving clouds and glowing colours.

      In Seoul, we developed an interactive LED wall on a massive scale (90m2),
      inviting visitors to fly a plane over world cities using their own bodies
      to control the movement.

      In our custom-built 3D environment, a classic plane (which mimics a real
      version displayed in the exhibition) encounters famous world monuments as
      it makes a seemingly endless journey soaring above the clouds.

      The installation rewarded exploration, causing the plane to pull special
      maneuvers around the monuments when steered close enough.

      For the New York edition of the exhibition, our space was a long corridor
      rather than an entranceway. Here we presented a digital subway station,
      crafted with Louis Vuitton styling. A 22m long video wall allowed a
      life-size train to enter the space at set intervals, accompanied by an
      immersive 6-speaker soundscape.

      The installation combined digital and physical elements, connected by the
      same design language.
