      For the Shanghai edition, we created an atmospheric space, in-between
      night and day, adorned with lanterns and flooded by neon light. Hanging
      from the ceiling in an assortment of shapes and sizes, each lantern was
      embedded with LED panel with synchronised scrolling messages and graphics,
      welcoming visitors. Overhead, we installed an ever-shifting digital
      ‘skylight’, animated by moving clouds and glowing colours.

Louis Vuitton’s traveling exhibition “Volez, Voguez, Voyagez” (Fly, Sail,
Travel) retraces the adventure of the House of Louis Vuitton from 1854 to the
present. For the Seoul, New York City and Shanghai editions of this
exhibition, we created high-impact entrance statements to welcome guests into
Louis Vuitton's world of travel.
