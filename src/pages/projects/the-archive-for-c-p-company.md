title: The Archive for C.P. Company
intro: >-
  We are proud to join C.P. Company’s 50th anniversary ‘Cinquenta’ celebrations
  and help them bring their extensive archive to life – in both a digital and
  physical form. Spearheaded by designer Massimo Otti, the legendary brand
  pioneered Italian sportswear in their experimental garment laboratory,
  blending the functionality of military wear with textile innovation to create
  hybrid urban sportswear.

    caption: The online archive we designed pays homage to Osti’s trailblazing
      process-based vision, bringing together five-decade’s worth of garments,
      objects, sketches and editorials into a behind-the-scenes experience of
      the lab. Visitors can journey through the archive as Osti himself might
      use it.

    caption: Each artefact is of equal importance, grouped together on the landing
      page yet navigable using a filter-system. Clicking on an object leads you
      on a deep-dive into its life-story, from pre-production research to how
      it’s worn on the streets today.

    caption: Informed by C.P.’s material processes, the website transitions
      reference the tactility of each artefact, inviting visitors to feel the
      garments as well as read about them. A tool that collects, highlights and
      contextualises the research behind the brand’s innovation, the archive is
      a living entity; one that can be added to in years to come.

    caption: For the physical rendition of the archive, premiering at Pitti Uomo, we
      created an installation where visitors can ‘scroll’ through the online
      archive. Upon entering the pavilion, visitors encounter a single archive
      rack framing a flag fashioned out of 50 patches of dyed fabric; a symbolic
      object to celebrate C.P. Company’s Cinquenta. This rack is used as a
      control to navigate through the digital archive so the public can immerse
      themselves in C.P. Company’s story through audio and images. A hybrid of
      physical and digital space, the exhibition offers visitors an embodied
      experience of the often-hidden brand archive.
