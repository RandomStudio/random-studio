title: The Archive for C.P. Company
intro: >-
  We are proud to join C.P. Company’s 50th anniversary ‘Cinquenta’ celebrations
  and help them bring their extensive archive to life – in both a digital and
  physical form. Spearheaded by designer Massimo Otti, the legendary brand
  pioneered Italian sportswear in their experimental garment laboratory,
  blending the functionality of military wear with textile innovation to create
  hybrid urban sportswear.
