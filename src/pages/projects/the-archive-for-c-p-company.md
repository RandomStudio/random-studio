title: The Archive for C.P. Company
intro: >-
  We are proud to join C.P. Company’s 50th anniversary ‘Cinquenta’ celebrations
  and help them bring their extensive archive to life – in both a digital and
  physical form. Spearheaded by designer Massimo Otti, the legendary brand
  pioneered Italian sportswear in their experimental garment laboratory,
  blending the functionality of military wear with textile innovation to create
  hybrid urban sportswear.

    caption: The online archive we designed pays homage to Osti’s trailblazing
      process-based vision, bringing together five-decade’s worth of garments,
      objects, sketches and editorials into a behind-the-scenes experience of
      the lab. Visitors can journey through the archive as Osti himself might
      use it.
