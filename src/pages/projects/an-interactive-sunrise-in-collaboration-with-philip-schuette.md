title: An interactive sunrise in collaboration with Philip Schuette
intro: >-
  This interactive installation was made in collaboration with our Creative Lead
  and artist Philip Schuette and turns one of nature’s most mediated phenomena–
  the rising and setting of the sun – into a playful sensory experience.

      Using a giant bouncy ball, viewers can control the movement of the sun
      over a digitally sublime landscape: a hyper real vista where the sun’s
      cycle is recoded as a malleable event. Bridging the digital and the
      physical, SUN uses technology to reflect on how it’s shaping the way we
      experience the world.

      The idea for SUN was born from seeing development prototypes of a computer
      game that uses algorithms to created infinite, unique universes. Struck by
      the starry-eyed possibility of discovering these familiar yet totally
      self-generated landscapes, Schütte began to wonder what would be an
      immediate way of feeling like you were in control of the sun. One of the
      most basic and universal human experiences, and also the most widely
      photographed, placed in your hands in the shape of a giant bouncy ball.

      Developed in WebGL using the 3D framework Three.js and custom shaders, the
      manmade sun in the piece interacts with the atmosphere and scatters light
      across the crisp, digital horizon based on how you move the ball. SUN is
      projected on a big screen, summoning both the spectacular feeling of the
      sun whilst revelling in its own artificiality. Shifting across digital and
      physical space, the addictive experience of playing somewhere in-between
      the two triggers a split-second of awe when you realise what is in your
      power.
