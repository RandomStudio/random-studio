      Hidden Characters




      Who do you live with? Hidden Character uses AR to bring your furniture to life. Set free your inner child and get to know your roommates by scanning objects with a tablet to transform them into characters—each based on the unique properties of the object itself.




      We collaborated with [Anton Hjertstedt](https://antonhjertstedt.com/) for the design of the characters.

      Point & Repair




      How can we dialogue with objects in our home? Can smart homes talk back? Point & Repair explores new interfaces that encourage a more natural way of interacting with the objects in your home. Transforming the current smart home setup, where we are responsible for controlling objects, Point & Repair creates a two-way relationship in which the home plays a more vocal role.




      Combining voice and visual interface, the experience allows objects to ask questions, make suggestions and learn more about the user. Through an evolving exchange, you can get to know objects like your furniture better and figure out what upkeep they need and when, for a more conscious way of living.

      Home Puzzle




      What would your room look like if it had a refresh? Home Puzzle lets your imagination loose to experiment with your living space. Make a scan of your room and mark the objects you want to reposition. Try out different layouts or even turn your room into a playground with the snow globe, release gravity and shake to randomize features. A combination of diminished reality and photogrammetry allows you to visualise this process directly in front of your eyes.
