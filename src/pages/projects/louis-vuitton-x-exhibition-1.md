title: 'Louis Vuitton X Exhibition '
intro: >-
  The Louis Vuitton X Exhibition celebrates 160 years of its pioneering creative
  exchanges and artistic collaborations. Tasked with bringing the brand’s
  heritage into the now, Random Studio designed LED paneling into the walls and
  ceiling of the ‘Origins Room’: a space that restages the fashion house’s early
  artistic collaborations through a collection of items from the archive from
  early sketches to one-of-a-kind pieces.
