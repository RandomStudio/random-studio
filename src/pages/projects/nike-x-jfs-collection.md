templateKey: Project
title: "Nike x JFS Collection "
intro: We were commissioned to create a campaign around the Nike x JFS
  collection. Centered on the theme of modularity, the collection responded to
  the different needs of the body in motion. We drew inspiration from this core
  concept, playing with sequence, function and versatility through campaign
  photography, an event and in-store retail displays in all of Nike Labâ€™s
  locations, and select retailers across the world.

    caption: Kicking off with an event at Spring Studios in New York, we created a
      modular space made up of different pieces that could be combined or used
      separately. Three frames brought to life the key product of the
      collection, a cape, suspended in three different states of wear. Visitors
      were invited to journey through the space, guided by a progression of
      colour, to discover the products and their many uses.

    caption: For the in-store installations, we developed the modular frame display.
      Additional silhouettes brought a dynamic motion to each space, referencing
      the body-centered concept of the collection and the shapes and visuals of
      training. The collection lived over two seasons, evolving into a different
      colour palette.
