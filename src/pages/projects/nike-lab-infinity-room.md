title: An infinity room for NikeLab
intro: >-
  NikeLab fuses physical retail, online commerce and digital engagement
  environments in order to provide customers with Nike’s innovative expressions.
  For the launch of the LunarEpic Flyknit shoe in the London store, we conceived
  an immersive space that invited visitors to put the shoe to the test in an
  experiential set up.

      With the Infinity Room, one could discover the shoe’s features by actually
      wearing them in action. Amid a pulsing light- and soundscape, and fully
      surrounded by mirrors, the athlete-for-the-moment ran on a real treadmill
      into what seemed to be infinity. Automatically triggering cameras, runners
      are shot from three different angles: front, feet and back. As a bonus,
      one left with a personalized kaleidoscopic video – created in real time
      and delivered within seconds afterwards to their mailbox.




      We have developed an expertise in immersive installations with a focus on
      the creation of shareable imagery. Earlier collaborations with Nike
      include an animated LED football pitch for the European Street Football
      League Final in Berlin called Nike Football X, and a surveillance-themed
      installation to mark the drop of a strictly limited edition footwear,
      created with Errolson Hugh of avant-garde label Acronym, NikeLab x ACRNM.

      The lights pulse along with audio, launching into a faster loop as the
      runner breaks into a jog, surrounded by a myriad of reflected visions.

      Functioning as a remote for the installation, the interface allowed Nike
      teams to control the room’s light and sound scenography and trigger the
      recording of the digital takeaway.

      The kaleidoscopic edit was rendered automatically and delivered straight
      to the runner’s inbox after review, complete with sharing instructions.
