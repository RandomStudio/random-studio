  ***TEST*** </br>Various in-store installations
  for NikeLab
intro: >-
  NikeLab is a retail destination that serves to spark consumer discovery in new
  and unexpected ways. For the launch of the 2017 ACG (All Conditions Gear)
  collection, we created various stylised weather conditions (wind, rain and
  fog) that seized two of the brand’s stores around the globe.

          Conceived as a means of bringing about a relevant experience that
          connects people with a product devised for use in extreme urban
          weather conditions, visitors to the NikeLabs 1948 store in London
          encountered an actual in-store tornado. A system of fans created the
          vortex effect required and allowed the steam to be contained in wall
          of wind. Customers were able touch, play and break the tornados wind
          barrier, adding to the tangibility of the installation.

          For NikeLab 21M store in New York we placed suspended sheets of “smart
          fog” amongst the apparel that reacted to approaching guests, changing
          from transparent to foggy. Motion sensors were used to trigger an
          eerie techno-fog effect as well as the interruption of an electrical
          charge causing the repurposed security smart glass to switch from
          transparent to the natural cloudy state.
