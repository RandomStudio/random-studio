title: An immersive in-store environment for NikeLab Milano
intro: >-
  For NikeLab’s FA18 Tech Pack launch in Milan, we were asked to transform the
  store into an immersive retail experience and hub for the city’s sharpest
  creatives to come together for a series of in-store events. We designed and
  created a Tech Pack ‘Atelier’ that made visible, and physical, the inner
  workings of the collection.

      The Tech Pack collection is the sportswear of the future: engineered to
      the body, it integrates body-informed and environmental data into its
      designs. We wanted to create a hyper-responsive environment based on this
      ethos, seamlessly connecting and tracking the different spaces of the
      store and the people in it.

      The experience started outside. The store windows were fitted with cameras
      so passer-bys could see themselves tracked on screen.

      On the first floor, a conveyor belt scanned items from the collection,
      triggering product content on the screens above. A series of screens on
      the other side streamed and analysed live footage from the floor below.

      The vaults celebrated the creativity behind the Tech Pack: all three
      product collaborations – designed with a handful of Milan’s top
      influencers – were showcased in a special exhibition space. Next to it was
      the workshop, a space where customisation events could be held.
