title: Cinematic Scenography for Bottega Veneta
intro: >-
  In celebration of Bottega Venetaâ€™s first runway collection, MATCHESFASHION
  created an installation in their innovative retail space 5 Carlos Place in
  Mayfair, London. Riffing off the Italian tradition of craftsmanship and
  sophistication that defines the brand, Random Studio developed a visual layer
  of narrative inspired by classic Italian cinema to frame the collection
  display.






  We set out to fuse the architecture of a London townhouse with the signs and
  symbols of Italian cinema, which echoed through the space. Using bespoke,
  miniature video players that neatly fit the space, abstract fragments of films
  and iconic images of elegance flickered across the walls and ceilings,
  translating cinematography into scenography.
