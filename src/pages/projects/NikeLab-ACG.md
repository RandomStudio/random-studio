  Various in-store installations
  for NikeLab
intro: >-
  NikeLab is a retail destination that serves to spark consumer discovery in new
  and unexpected ways. For the launch of the 2017 ACG (All Conditions Gear)
  collection, we created various stylised weather conditions (wind, rain and
  fog) that seized two of the brand’s stores around the globe.

      Conceived as a means of bringing about a relevant experience that connects
      people with a product devised for use in extreme urban weather conditions,
      visitors to the NikeLabs 1948 store in London encountered an actual
      in-store tornado. A system of fans created the vortex effect required and
      allowed the steam to be contained in wall of wind. Customers were able
      touch, play and break the tornados wind barrier, adding to the tangibility
      of the installation.

      The prototype developed for the Shanghai store but not eventually realised
      in-store, was the experience of rainfall. Proximity sensors detecting
      users location triggered a combination of alternating strobe lighting and
      projected video content. When viewed through a trickling rain curtain the
      overall effect was one of frozen rain droplets with a backdrop of urban
      ACG video content.

      For NikeLab 21M store in New York we placed suspended sheets of “smart
      fog” amongst the apparel that reacted to approaching guests, changing from
      transparent to foggy. Motion sensors were used to trigger an eerie
      techno-fog effect as well as the interruption of an electrical charge
      causing the repurposed security smart glass to switch from transparent to
      the natural cloudy state.

      Essential to the project was the idea of confrontation and evoking a sense
      of wonder by inviting the visitor to interact with the respective weather
      condition specific to each installation. How often is one confronted with
      extreme weather conditions inside a store? Daan Lucas, managing director
      at Random: “We played with the notion of connecting to people in a
      surprising, relevant and emotional way. Another important element is time:
      It needs to ‘happen’. If you make an experience too complex, it takes too
      long for people to master.”
