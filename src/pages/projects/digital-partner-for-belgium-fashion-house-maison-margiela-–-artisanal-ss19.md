title: Digital Partner for Belgium fashion house Maison Margiela – Artisanal SS19
intro: >-
  Since Spring-Summer 19, we have been collaborating with Maison Margiela as a
  digital partner for six of their collections. Guided by John Galliano’s
  radical and unique vision, the collections are highly-considered
  constellations of ideas, craftsmanship and performance. Our job has been to
  understand the core concepts of each collection, and translate them into a
  multifaceted contemporary visual experience: from runway videos and live show
  streams to podcasts and photoshoots.




  Rather than ‘documenting’ an end-product, we have become part of the making-process itself. Drawing on the maison’s craft-based approach, we have come up with tailor-made formats and visual communication strategies that respond to the specific themes and language of each season. Building new forms that work alongside Galliano’s avant-garde thought-process, the digital universes we have created are an extension of the collection, rather than a documentation of it.

      Artisanal SS19


      This season was part of Galliano’s research into a ‘New Glamour’, with the latest instalment revolving around the cyclical nature of decadence. A riot of bright colours and jittering computer-generated imagery, the collection bubbles with the excess and artifice of the digital world and its flood of overlapping information.

    caption: Our documentation of the show played on the borders of fake and real.
      The show itself was a spectacle-like affair so we captured it from every
      angle and perspective, creating a stream of different images and content
      including the main runway video, live-editing for Instagram Live, a
      pre-show teaser, a podcast teaser, a series of backstage videos and
      backstage and empty-set photography. The main video played on the
      reflected images of the mirrored runway, shot with rotating cameras to
      blur the lines between reality and its image.
