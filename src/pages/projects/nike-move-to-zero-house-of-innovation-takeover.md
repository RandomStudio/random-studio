title: Nike Move to Zero House of Innovation Takeover
intro: >-
  We teamed up with Nike to help translate their Move to Zero campaign into a
  physical environment for a store takeover at the House of Innovation in Paris.
  The brand’s longterm journey towards zero carbon and waste is a constellation
  of different stories and ideas that has so far mostly lived online as a
  Circular Design Guide. 


  We were excited to tackle the challenge of transforming the website into a dynamic physical space, full of tangible, moving parts; one that both brings customers into the brand’s sustainability story, but also informs, educates and inspires them to become part of the journey by getting involved in caring for their own products.
