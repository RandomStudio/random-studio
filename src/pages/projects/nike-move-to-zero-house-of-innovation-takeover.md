title: Nike Move to Zero House of Innovation Takeover
intro: >-
  We teamed up with Nike to help translate their Move to Zero campaign into a
  physical environment for a store takeover at the House of Innovation in Paris.
  The brand’s longterm journey towards zero carbon and waste is a constellation
  of different stories and ideas that has so far mostly lived online as a
  [Circular Design Guide](https://www.nikecirculardesign.com/). 


  We were excited to tackle the challenge of transforming the website into a dynamic physical space, full of tangible, moving parts; one that both brings customers into the brand’s sustainability story, but also informs, educates and inspires them to become part of the journey by getting involved in caring for their own products.

    caption:
      Filling the ground floor of Nike’s House of Innovation on the Champs
      Elysee, the space proposes a holistic, circular journey that makes visible
      the many layers of production, from material choices right through to the
      refurbishment of products, through concrete examples. Starting from the
      windows, visitors see a conveyor belt moving trash across the display,
      while inside screens add a digital layer that brings to life the different
      products made out of this material. Next to the belt, you can even drop
      your old Nikes into a bin to turn them into a new product. Instead of
      encountering perfect, finished products, visitors get a behind-the-scenes
      look into a sustainable cycle of production in action.

    caption: In the centre of the store, a museum-like set up of 10 cabinets
      continues the journey by exploring the core principles of Nike’s Circular
      Design, each telling a different microstory through a graphic composition
      of information, images, videos, materials, case studies and products.
      Drawing on the grid systems of web design, we created 4 multi-layered
      template layouts for the cabinets, ensuring that each could host a range
      of different content. In keeping with our own sustainability efforts as a
      studio, we worked on keeping the production process streamline by using
      only 4 designs, building the cabinets with sustainable materials, reusing
      fixtures from previous campaigns where possible and designing the
      infrastructure to be reusable for future campaigns.

      In the Trash Hacker’s Gallery, pedestals and mannequin podiums in the
      middle of the space provide a platform for ‘hacked’ creations made by
      local talents and curated by the House of Innovation. After learning about
      the brand’s sustainable efforts and best practices, visitors can visit the
      TrashLab to prepare for getting hands on. Here, they receive a DIY kit and
      learn how to repair and upcycle their own products. Rounding off the
      brand’s sustainability story with a DIY actionable activity transforms the
      space into a more collective, connected experience, where visitors are
      inspired to play a role in sustainability too.
