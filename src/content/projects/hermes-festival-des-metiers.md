title: An exhibition for Hermès
intro: >-
  At its core, the world of Hermès is a world of beautiful materials, mastered
  by highly skilled artisans. Festival des Métiers is a travelling exhibition
  that offers visitors the chance to meet the craftsmen of the house. We created
  three interactive exhibits that reveal the manufacturing details that normally
  remain invisible to the naked eye.

      Various work stations showed the diverse skills and phases that precede a
      precious accessory. Typical to the festival is its unpretentious
      character, or as the French say, “with its feet on the ground and its head
      in the sky”.




      It prompted us to create digital additions that fitted in naturally with
      the overall feel of the exhibition.  Steering away from technology-minded
      and rather alienating “highlight interventions" often seen in exhibition
      design, we opted for digital moments with artistic, fanciful and didactic
      qualities.

      Magnifying goggles traditionally used by the specialized metalworkers
      inspired Random to create Digital Binoculars that make one peer into a
      Museum Grade vitrine filled with the House’s accessories.

      Through the goggles, spectators see the manual fabrication and assembly
      steps from an artisan’s angle, scaled to the point it feels as if doing it
      themselves.

      At the touch of one’s fingertips, the video slows down dramatically, and a
      dance of materials being woven together with grace and perfection unfolds
      itself.

      At the leatherworking station, a Digital Picture Frame lets spectators see
      the material through the eyes of the craftsman.

      Life marks, wrinkles and inferior parts of the leather lead the artisan to
      decide how to lay out and cut the pattern of each Hermès bag.
