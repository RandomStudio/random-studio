title: An archival experience celebrating C.P. Company’s anniversary – Milan edition
intro: To round off C.P. Company’s 50th anniversary Cinquanta celebrations, we brought the interactive spatial archive we made for the brand last year to its home turf of Milan for the finnisage of their anniversary celebrations. Designed and built as a modular hybrid of physical and digital space, the exhibition premiered in Florence at Pitti Uomo 2021, then was installed in Darwen, UK, as part of the British Textile Biennale before travelling to BASE, a cultural center in Milan

      Reusing the majority of the fixtures from the Darwen exhibition – and sourcing local materials for the rest – we always conceived the interactive archive as a long-lasting, flexible entity that was easy to move and adapt to different spaces. The Milan edition offers a new visitor journey through the archive using unique spatial design and lighting, complimented by the addition of a bookshop and a section celebrating 10 anniversary collaborations.

      Working with five-decade’s worth of C.P. Company's hybrid urban sportswear, objects, sketches and editorials, visitors are invited to ‘scroll’ the brand’s rich history using interactive racks or explore a wider ecosystem of digital content through scannable Garment Cards. The result is an embodied experience of the often-hidden brand archive.
