title: A live spectacle for Chloé's SS21 Collection
intro: >-


  For their SS21 collection, we worked with Natacha Ramsay-Levi from Chloé to imagine and create a live spectacle spilling through the streets of Paris, its grand finale unfolding against the backdrop of the Palais de Tokyo.


  An ambitious collision between going to the movies, the theatre and a fashion show, we conceptualised, choreographed and executed the multilayered event from start to finish; from trailers and teasers to the live event, to livestream, to its digital afterlife.

    caption: Centering around the themes of sisterhood and togetherness that
      underpin the collection, the spectacle captures snippets from the lives of
      37 contemporary Chloé women as they cruise their city’s streets to reach
      the show; a colourful tapestry of criss-crossing micro-narratives.
      Resisting the constraints of the catwalk, the presentation played out in
      the wild, using the city as a set for a play in two acts.

      audience seated at the Palais de Tokyo, their backs facing the Seine, and
      another much larger digital audience scattered across the world, facing
      their screens, both watching the spectacle play out in real-time.'

    caption:
      On location, three zoom camera towers were erected, each capturing the
      actors/models from a distance and streaming it live to three grand
      portrait LED walls bordering the square. Guests watched a triptych
      capturing the models drifting through the streets to a polyphonic
      soundscape that builds with every new character.

    caption: The cameras traced small moments of beauty in the journeys of the
      individual models until they finally came together to form a tableaux
      vivant at the Palais de Tokyo. Like actors stepping out of the screen and
      into real life, the models then walked the catwalk one after the other,
      the cameras capturing the detail of each garment.
