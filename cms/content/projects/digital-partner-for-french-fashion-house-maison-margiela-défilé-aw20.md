title: Digital Partner for French Fashion House Maison Margiela – Défilé AW20
intro: >-
  Since Spring-Summer 19, we have been collaborating with Maison Margiela as a
  digital partner for six of their collections. Guided by John Galliano’s
  radical and unique vision, the collections are highly-considered
  constellations of ideas, craftsmanship and performance. Our job has been to
  understand the core concepts of each collection, and translate them into a
  multifaceted contemporary visual experience: from runway videos and live show
  streams to podcasts and photoshoots.




  Rather than ‘documenting’ an end-product, we have become part of the making-process itself. Drawing on the maison’s craft-based approach, we have come up with tailor-made formats and visual communication strategies that respond to the specific themes and language of each season. Building new forms that work alongside Galliano’s avant-garde thought-process, the digital universes we have created are an extension of the collection, rather than a documentation of it.

      Défilé AW20


      Continuing on the theme of remixing the house’s heritage, Galliano’s concept of ‘Recicla’ – resurrecting and deconstructing shapes from the past – was at the core of this collection. Driven by a new obsession with uniforms, the garments played on the idea of ‘work-in-progress’ as a new approach for the house’s future.

      Galliano’s obsession was something we wanted to amplify in the assets
      we created, highlighting small details such as the vegetables decorating
      some of the outfits and the unique cuts of each altered uniform.
